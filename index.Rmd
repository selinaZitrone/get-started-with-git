# Prerequisites

To follow everything we discuss in the workshop you need to prepare a few things:

## 1. Install git on your machine

If you don't have git installed already, follow the instructions below to install git for your OS.

**For Windows**

You can download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Download and install the correct version for your machine (probably 64 bit).

With the git installation for windows, you should also get a program called `Git bash`. 
Git bash is a linux like command line for Windows.

When you are done, open this program (you can find it after searching for it in the Windows search bar) 
and run `git --version`. If you successfully installed git, you should see the version
of git that you are using printed to the console.

**For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

You can install git in the terminal. Run

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

Check the version of git that you have installed with

```
git --version
```

**For MacOS**
