title: Create a pull request on Github
---

You can create a pull request when you want to integrate changes that you made on
one branch into the main branch. 

Usually a pull request is then reviewed by a collaborator before the changes are 
accepted.

If you go to your remote repository on Github, Github should automatically detect
new branches and ask you to create a pull request for it.

It should look something like this:

Click on `Compare & pull request`.

Now you can add a title and description for your pull request. This can be quite a
long text if you made lots of changes that you need to explain.
When you are finished click on `Create pull request`.

Now your (potential) collaborators can browse your code and make comments.

To see how it looks like, make a comment yourself.

On top, you can go to `Files changed` and see all the differences that are made in this pull request.

You can select single or multiple lines of code and add comments to it.

Just explore the functionality of pull requests a bit by yourself.
