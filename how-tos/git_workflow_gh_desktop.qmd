title: "A Git workflow with Github Desktop"
---

In this guide, we will create a small cook book project using Git. We will
add recipes and commit the our repository and then publish the project on Github
to collaborate with others on it.

# Prerequisites

To follow this workflow you need:

- Git installed
- Github Desktop installed
- A Github account connected to your Github Desktop program

Have a look at the [course preparations](../course_preparation.qmd)

# A Git workflow with Github Desktop

## Step 1: Initialize a new repository

To initialize a new Git repository with Github Desktop, you have to options: You 
create an empty project with a repository or you add a repository to an existing 
project. For our cook book, we chose option 1 because we don't have an project yet.

### Option 1: New project

Go to **File -> New repository** (keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + N)

![](img/ghd_new_repo.png)

This opens up the dialog box to create a new repository. 
You can give your repository a name, add an optional description and choose where on your computer it should be 
created. You can also initialize the repo with a REAMDE file inside. This is 
always a good idea as you can use this file to guide users (or you from the
future) through the repository. For this example, my project looks like this:

![](img/ghd_new_repo_create.png)
Click on **Create repository** when you are done.

### Option 2: Existing project

If you already have a project, that you want to put under version control, you can
go to **File -> Add local repository**
(keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + O)

![](img/ghd_add_repo.png)

If your project is not Git repository yet, you will get a warning and the program suggest 
you to **create a repository** instead. Click on that link:

![](img/ghd_add_repo_create.png)
Fill out the dialog box just like in option 1 but leave the project name as 
suggested by Github Desktop to match the folder name you already created.

Click on **Create repository** when you are done.

## Step 2: Add a recipe

Open your cook book project in the file explorer (**Repository -> Show in Explorer**).

Add a new text file for your favorite recipe. I will add `pie.txt`.
Add the recipe text to the file, e.g.:

```md
Ingredients:
150 g butter
200 g sugar
3 eggs
350 g flour
1 pkg. baking powder
juice from one lemon

Mix everything together and put in the oven
for 45 mins at 200 Â°C.
```

After you added a recipe, switch back to Github Desktop.

### Explore the changes

Github Desktop recorded all the changes to your project.
Have a look at the user interface to see how much information and options it gives you:

![](img/ghd_add_pie.png)

Notice, that by default, Github Desktop stages your files (i.e. marks them to be part of the next commit).
If you want to remove a file from the staging area, just uncheck the box next to the file.

## Step 3: Make a commit

To commit the changes to your local repository, you need to enter
a commit message (Github Desktop suggests you something, but you can change it).

Optionally, you can add a more detailed description of you changes in the 
description box below:

![](img/ghd_commit.png)

When you are ready click on **Commit to main**.

Please note that there are guidelines on how to write good commit messages.
This becomes especially important when collaborating.
Have a look [here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for some guidelines.

### Look at the history

To look at the history of your commits, you can go to the history view
of Github desktop. It gives you all the details about previous commits:

![](img/ghd_history.png)

## Step 4: Create a remote repository and push your changes

Now we want to share our cook book with the world. Using Github Desktop makes it
very easy to publish a repository on Github.
Just click **Publish repository** on the top right.
In the dialogue box that opens, you can choose whether to make your code public 
or keep it private. Optionally, you can add a description which will be displayed on
Github. This is how my cook book repository looks like:

![](img/ghd_publish_repo.png)
When you are done click **Publish repository**.

You can checkout how your Github repository looks online by going to 
**Repository -> View on GitHub**.

## Step 5: Push new changes to Github

Once, you published the repository on Github, you can push new changes up there 
to update the remote repository.

Just continue working locally, add new recipe files, update existing recipes and commit
the changes when you are done.
Just click on one of the two **Push** buttons update the Github repository with the
latest local changes:

# Collaboration using branching

Git and Github are perfect for collaboration. Let's assume our friend also has a
cook-book project on Github and we want to work together with them on the book.

If you want to try the workflow by collaborating with yourself, you can just skip
step 1 and do the other steps with your own instead of your friend's cook book.

## Add collaborators to Github repository

To collaborate, your friend needs to add you to their Github project.
On the Github webpage, they can go to **Settings -> Collaborators -> Add people**:

![](img/gh_add_collaborator.png)
Your friend can then add your Github user name and you will get an invitation email
for the repository. Accept this invitation and you are now a collaborator on your
friend's project.

## Step 1: Clone a remote repository

First, we need to clone our friend's repository. This means we pull an entire copy
of the repository onto our machine. To clone a repository, you need to know the 
repositories address. You can find the HTTPS address by clicking on the green code button on Github:

![](img/gh_copy_adress.png)
Go to Github Desktop and **File -> Clone repository**. In the dialogue box that opens
You can either clone repositories from

- Github.com: Here you can scroll through a list of all your Github repositories. 
Maybe this list already shows the repository of your friend because you are now a 
collaborator.
- URL: Enter the URL of your friends repo that you copied from Github

If you enter the URL, you can select the location where the repository should be stored in:

![](img/ghd_clone.png)
When you are ready click on **Clone**.

Now you can start working with the repository of your friend.

## Step 2: Create a new branch

To use the collaboration workflow discussed in the lecture, you need to create a new branch
when you want to do some work. Let's say, I want to add some vegan pie recipe.
In Github Desktop, go to **Branch -> New Branch**.
Give the branch a short but meaningful name and then click on **Create branch**:

![](img/ghd_new_branch.png)

Github Desktop will also automatically switch to this branch for you. 
You can see your current branch and switch branches on top:

![](img/ghd_switch_branch.png)

Now you can start working on this branch. Add a file for the vegan pie and then
commit them like you are used to (see how-to above).

## Step 3: Publish and push your branch to remote

To make your branch with the vegan pie recipe available for you friend, you need 
to push the branch to the remote repository on Github. This works just like with the main 
branch. On the top right, just click the **Push** button (The first time, this button will say **Publish branch** instead of Push).

Now your branch should be pushed to Github and you can do a pull request.

## Step 4: Create a pull request

See [here](create_pull_request.qmd) for a guide on how to create a pull requests
to ask your friend to integrate your recipe into their cookbook.

# Other things to try

## Revert a commit

If you want to undo a commit without deleting the whole commit history, you can revert the respective commit. Just go to the history tab in Github Desktop and find the commit you want to revert. Now right-click on the commit and select **Revert changes in commit**:

![](img/ghd_revert.png)

Github Desktop will create a new commit that reverts the original commit:

![](img/ghd_revert_commit.png)

This commit can be pushed just like any other commit. This is a safe way to undo changes.
