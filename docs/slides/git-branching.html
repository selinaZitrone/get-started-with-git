# Before we start

Change default branch name for `git init`

```sh
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Some thoughts on GUI clients


&gt; "I sometimes encounter people who feel it’s “better” to use command line Git, but for very ill-defined reasons. These people may feel like they should work in the shell, even if it leads to Git-avoidance, frequent mistakes, or limiting themselves to a small set of ~3 Git commands. This is counterproductive."

from [Happy git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html) (follow link for some git client suggestions)

# Collaboration with git


.pull-left[

**Prerequisite for collaboration on one remote**: Add collaborators to the project to have correct permissions

## Simple option

- One remote and multiple local repos
- **Everyone works on same branch** and use push and pull to sync

]

# Collaboration with git


.pull-left[

## Simple option

- One remote and multiple local repos
- **Everyone works on same branch** and use push and pull to sync


**This works good if e.g.**

- Repo is not updated too often
- One person primarily pushes, others mostly pull
- No need for discussing code
  - everything that is pushed is directly integrated into the repo

## Simple option

- One remote and multiple local repos
- **Everyone works on same branch** and use push and pull to sync


**Problems with this approach**

- If more people push often -&gt; conflicts to solve on main

- Not possible to discuss/improve code before integration

- Difficult to just "try something out"

## More complex workflow

- One remote and multiple local repos
- One main branch that only has code that is agreed upon and tested
- Everyone works on separate branches and requests a merge if they are finished

**Advantages**

- It can be guaranteed that main always works
- Code can be reviewed before it's integrated
- Potential conflicts don't have to be solved on the main branch

First understand the concept of **branching** and **merging**

---
# Branches in git

&lt;br&gt;

.center[![](img/branching/git-commit-line.png)]

--
&lt;br&gt;
- All repositories start with a default branch (main/master)

  - As long as you work on one branch and just make changes in working directory, stage and commit them, you don't really care about branches



---
# Branches in git

  .center[![:scale 60%](img/branching/branch-concept.png)]


--

- **Branches** are lightweight movable pointers to commits

  - at every commit, branch pointer moves forward automatically
  
--

- **HEAD** is a pointer that points to the local branch that is checked out (i.e. that you are currently on)

---
# Creating a new branch `git branch`

.center[![:scale 60%](img/branching/git-branch-new.png)]

--

- Create a new branch in a local repository with `git branch &lt;branch_name&gt;`


---
# Creating a new branch `git branch`

&lt;br&gt;

![Branches in a repository](img/branching/repo-branches.png)

- For now, the `change_alice` branch only exists locally

- Check which branches there are with 

```sh
git branch -a
```

--

- **Idea:** Make changes in this new branch and then merge them back into the main/master branch

---
# Switching branches `git checkout`

--

&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[

- Switch to a different branch with &lt;br&gt;
`git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;`

- This moves the HEAD pointer

- Add and commit changes to this branch as usually

]
.pull-right[![Git checkout concept](img/branching/git-checkout-concept.png)]

--

- Create and checkout a new branch in one command with

```sh
git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;
```

---
# Working on another branch

Working with git works the same in every branch:

- Make changes

- Stage changes with `git add`

- Commit changes with `git commit`

- Push them to remote with `git push`

---
# Add local branches to remote `git push`

- If you want to push a new local branch to the remote for the first time, you have to explicitly set an upstream branch &lt;br&gt;

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin &lt;branch_name&gt;
```

&lt;br&gt;


![:scale 80%](img/branching/git-push-set-upstream-concept.png)

---
# Merging branches `git merge`

- Combining two branches

--

- You always merge **into** the branch you are currently on

```sh
git merge &lt;branch_to_merge&gt;
```

--

- E.g. to merge branch `change_alice` back into master, do

  - `git checkout master` to switch to master

  - `git merge change_alice`  to merge `change_alice` into master

---
# Fast forward merging

- No conflicts or diverging files

.right[![:scale 70%](img/branching/git-merge-fast-forward-1.png)]

--

.left[![](img/branching/git-merge-fast-forward-2.png)]

---
# Merging diverging branches

![Git merge with diverging branches](img/branching/git-merge-diverging-1.png)

---
# Merging diverging branches

- Merge commit is introduced

![Git merge with diverging branches](img/branching/git-merge-diverging.png)

---
# Merging with conflicts

- If you try to merge changes that interfere, you run into a merge conflict

- Solve it by hand

- Then stage and commit the changes to merge

- You can always abort this process with &lt;br&gt;

`git merge --abort`


---
# Pull requests on remote

.pull-left[

## More complex workflow

- One remote and multiple local repos
- One main branch that only has code that is agreed upon and tested
- **Everyone works on separate branches** and **requests a merge** if they are finished

]

.pull-right[

# Pull requests on remote

.pull-left[

## More complex workflow

- One remote and multiple local repos
- One main branch that only has code that is agreed upon and tested
- **Everyone works on separate branches** and **requests a merge** if they are finished

**Idea**

- Don't merge changes into the master yourself
- Push your local branch to github and **do a pull request** (i.e. request a merge)

]

.pull-right[

.center[![:scale 70%](img/branching/multi-branch-collab-pr.png)]]

---
# Pull requests on remote

Pull requests are not just simple merges.

Before the merge happens, collaborators can

- Read the description of your pull request
- Look at your code
- Comment on your code
- Request more changes

If everyone is happy, your branch is merged into master.

## Questions?

## Find exercise at the end of next presentation


---
# Getting changes from the remote `git fetch`

- With `git fetch`, changes are fetched but not merged into the local repo

- Use `git status` to see what is new on remote compared to your current local repo

&lt;br&gt;

![Git fetch concept](img/branching/git-fetch-concept.png)

---
# Getting changes from the remote `git pull`

- Changes are integrated directly into local branches and working directory

- Implicitly does a fetch first

--

- Often good to do fetch first and check what was updated in the remote
  - Avoids conflicts
  - Avoids pulling changes that you don't want
  - Important when working together
