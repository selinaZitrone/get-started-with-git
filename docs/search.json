On top, you can navigate to the presentation slides and the tasks.\nTo download presentation slides in pdf format, you can use the following links:\n\nPrerequisites\nTo follow everything we discuss in the workshop you need to prepare a few things:\n1. Install git on your machine\nIf you don’t have git installed already, follow the instructions below to install git for your OS.\nFor Windows\nYou can download git from here\nDownload and install the correct version for your machine (probably 64 bit).\nWith the git installation for windows, you should also get a program called Git bash. Git bash is a linux like command line for Windows.\nWhen you are done, open this program (you can find it after searching for it in the Windows search bar) and run git --version. If you successfully installed git, you should see the version of git that you are using printed to the console.\nFor Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\nYou can install git in the terminal. Run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git\nCheck the version of git that you have installed with\ngit --version\nFor MacOS\nSome versions of MacOS come with git preinstalled. To check if you already have it, open the terminal and run\ngit --version\nIf the terminal tells you which verison of git is installed, you can skip the next steps.\nIf you need to install git, you can do this with homebrew. Just run\nbrew install git\nThen check the version and verify the installation with\ngit --versions\nGithub/Gitlab account\nIf you don’t have a Gitlab or Github account yet, you can make one to follow the tutorials in the workshop. I will use Github in the examples that I will show you, but Gitlab will work as well.\nIf you don’t have any Account for a remote repository hoster, I suggest to make a Github account.\nTip: If you do your Github account with an institutional email address, you will get a free upgrade to Github Pro. This gives you some benefits like private wikis, … You can always add a second email address later or change it if you leave your institution.\nSSH Authentication\nIn order to communicate between your local machine and your Github/Gitlab account, you need to set up authentication via SSH keys. Please follow the instructions  here to do so.\n\n\n\n",
