## Description

Apart from letting you track your changes over time in your individual projects, Git is also very powerful when it
comes to collaboration with other people. In combination with a platform such as Github or
Gitlab, you can seamlessly collaborate without losing the overview of your project.

This session will be about:

- Branching and merging with Git
- A collaboration workflow with Github

Check out the [previous session](01_intro_git.qmd) if you missed it, 
where I talked about basic Git concepts and a simple Git workflow.
