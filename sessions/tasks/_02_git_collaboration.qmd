The goal of these tasks is to get a feeling for a collaborative Git workflow.

If you are stuck in a task, you can have a look at the [A How-To description](../how-tos/git_workflow_gh_desktop.qmd) of the Git workflow with detailed explanations and screenshots of the steps.

# 1 Clone 

## Clone the cook book repo of your partner (5 min)

Use Github Desktop to clone the cook book repository of your partner.

Go to **File -> Clone Repository**.

In the tab "Github.com" you will find a list of all your repositories, including the ones where you are a collaborator. Find the repository of your partner and clone it to a local path of your choice.

If you don't see your partners repository, switch to the tab "URL". Open your partner's repository on Github (find the correct link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tNwDnfKM84gI-Xd5myr4gbRRJeRGBvAuAr4YjOy-M-o/edit?usp=sharing)). On the Github page of the repo, click on the green code button on the top right, copy the HTTPS address and then paste it in the URL field of Github Desktop. Then clone it to a local path of your choice.

Open your partner's cook book in the explorer to see which files are already in there (**Repository -> Show in Explorer**).

# 2 Branch and merge

## Try branching and merging (10 min)

Make sure that you are in your team mate's cook book (check which repository you are in on the top left).

Create a new branch to add a recipe (**Branch -> New branch**).

Make sure that you are now in the new branch by looking in the top middle of Github Desktop what your current branch is:

![](tasks/img/current_branch.png)

Now go to the project folder (**Repository -> Show in Explorer**) and add a file for a new recipe with some recipe instructions in it.

Add and commit that new recipe to your branch. 

Now switch back to the main branch (click on the "current branch" button on top and select "main").

Merge your new branch into the main branch (**Branch -> Merge into current branch -> select your branch**). Now check the commit history to see if your branch commit is actually there.

Now push the "main" to Github by clicking the push button to share your changes with your team mate.

# 3 Pull requests

## Make a pull request in your partner's repo (10 min)

Now it's again time to modify something in your team mate's cook book. Make sure you are in your team mate's repository on the top left of Github desktop. 

#### Create another branch and make some changes

Create another branch (**Branch -> New branch**) and make sure that you are on that branch (top middle section of Github Desktop).

#### Make some changes

Open a file in your team mate's cook book and make some changes.
Save and close the file and switch to Github Desktop.

Now commit these changes.

#### Publish and push branch

Publish and push your branch to Github by clicking on the publish/push button.

#### Pull request

Now open the repository on Github (**Repository -> View on Github**).
On top you should already see the option to "Compare and pull request":

![](tasks/img/compare_and_pr.png)

Click on that button and use the dialogue window that opens to describe your changes. Then create the pull request by clicking on the green button that says "Create pull request".

# Extra

### Review pull request on your repo

Now it's time to look at the pull request your partner left in your repository and decide if you want to merge it or not.

When you have a pull request, you can see it on top, indicated by the number next to the pull request button:

![](tasks/img/new_pr.png)
Open the pull request by clickon on the button and selecting the Pull request from the list of pull requests.

Click through the tabs on top. E.g. the "Files changed" tab is very interesting.

You can comment on the pull request if you want and ask for changes.

When you are happy, you can merge the pull request by clicking on the green "Merge pull request" button:

![](tasks/img/merge_pr.png)

Now the changes are integrated into the main branch.
