The goal of these tasks is to get a feeling for the basic Git workflow.
In the tasks, I will not describe all steps in detail. But if you are stuck 
somewhere, have a look at the [how-to description](../how-tos/git_workflow_gh_desktop.qmd). There you find a guide of every step including screenshots. 
But most of the steps are made very intuitive with Github Desktop.

# 1 Clone (5 min)

Use Github Desktop to clone the cook book repository of your partner.

# Branch and merge (10 min)

Switch back to your personal cook book repository.

Create a new branch to add a recipe.

Make sure that you are now in the new branch by looking in the top middle of 
Github Desktop what your current branch is.

Now go to your project folder and add a file for the new recipe with some 
recipe instructions in it.

Add and commit that new file to your branch. 

Now switch back to the main branch (click on the "current branch" button on top).

Merge your new branch into the main branch. Then check the commit history to see
if you branch commit is actually there.

# Pull requests (20 min)

Now it's time to modify something in your partner's cook book. Switch to their 
repository and create a new branch for your changes. 

#### Make some changes

Change two things in your partner's cook book and commit them using 2 separate commits:

1) Add a new file with a new recipe
2) Open one of their recipes and make a change there. E.g. you can add or replace some ingredients.

#### Push

Publish and push your branch to Github.

#### Pull request

Open the repository on Github. On top you should already see the option to
"Compare and pull request". Open a pull request and describe your changes.

# Review pull request

Now it's time to look at your partner's pull request to decide if you want to
merge it or not.

Try to comment on single lines of code asking for changes.
