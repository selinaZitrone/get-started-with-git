## Description

Git is an essential skill if you use any programming language. It allows you to keep track of changes to your project over time, collaborate with others, and maintain a clear and organized project structure. This can save time, improve research efficiency, and also makes it easy to publish your code via platforms such as Github. 
This session will be about:

- The basic concepts behind Git
- A simple Git workflow for you individual projects
- Publishing projects on Github

In the [next session](02_git_collaboration.qmd), I will talk about a collaborative workflow using Git and
Github.
