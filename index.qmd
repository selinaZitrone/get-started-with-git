# Course description:

Git is an essential skill for anyone using a programming language. It helps you track changes to your project over time, collaborate with others, and maintain an organized project structure. This can save time, enhance research efficiency, and simplify code publishing on platforms like GitHub.

The main goal of this workshop is to give you the basic skills to start using Git for your own projects both individually and in collaboration with your friends & colleagues.

In 2 sessions, we will cover the following topics:

1. [Session 1](sessions/01_intro_git.qmd): Basic Git concepts and workflow for individual projects (Initializing a repository, commiting changes, pushing to a remote repository on GitHub)
2. [Session 2](sessions/02_git_collaboration.qmd): Collaborating with Git and GitHub (Branching, merging, pull requests)

You will learn both the theory and the practice with hands-on exercises.

## For whom is this course?

The target audience of this workshop are beginners without prior experience with Git and GitHub. However, the
workshop might also be interesting if you already use Git for your personal projects but want to learn more about the underlying concepts and collaboration using Git and GitHub. 

# Who is the instructor?
