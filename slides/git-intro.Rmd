# What is Git?

.pull-left[
- Stores snapshots (i.e. commits) of your project files
  - like a mini-filesystem

]
.pull-right[

]

--

.pull-left[

- Distributed version control system
  - (usually) one remote and one or more local repositories
  - everyone has full copy of project

# Why git?

- Complete and long-term history of every file in your project
  - Go back in time

--

- Documentation of every change
  - Who, what, when why?

--

- Repository on remote server (e.g. Github)
  - Additional backup
  - Access from browser
  - Share and collaborate
  - Sync between devices
  - Transparency

---
# Use cases

Git works best with **text files** (e.g. code), but you can also track other types of files

- Not good for very large files (there are other options such as git LFS)

---

# Git core concepts II

A git repository does not contain the files in a version that you can just open and edit.

.pull-left[
- **Repository:** 
  - Database of the project
  - Stores *all versions* of your project
- **Working directory:** 
  - Checkout *one version* of the project
  - Files can be edited here and then added into the repository
- **Staging area (index):** 
  - Collect changes to files here before commiting
  - Info of what goes into the next commit
]

# Basic workflow for working alone

I will show you everything in the command line. There are also GUI programs for git that you can switch to but the concepts are better learned in the terminal.

---
# Step 1: Initialize a git repository `git init`

To use git in any project, just navigate to the project folder and run `git init`

![](img/workflow/git-init.png)

--

This initializes a (hidden) `.git` folder that contains your git repository.
