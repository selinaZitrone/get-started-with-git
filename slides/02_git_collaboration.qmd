## Before we start

Did everyone accept a collaboration invitation?

## Recap

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width="70%"}

Basic Git workflow:

:::{.nonincremental}

1. **Initialize** a Git repository
2. **Work** on the project
3. **Stage** and **commit** files to the local repository
4. **Push** future changes to the remote repository

## Recap

Git is a **distributed version control system**

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

![](img/day1/distributed.png)

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

::: {.nonincremental}

- Idea: many *local* repositories synced via one *remote* repo

:::

- Collaborate with
  - yourself on different machines
  - your colleagues and friends
  - strangers on open source projects

## Get a repo from a remote

- In Git language, this is called **cloning**
  - Get a **full copy** of the remote repo

. . .

![](img/day2/git_clone_concept.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

- If the clone is authorized it can also commit and push

# Now you
> Clone your team mate's cook Book repo <br>
> It should be in the list of your repositories if you accepted the invitation.
> If not, check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tNwDnfKM84gI-Xd5myr4gbRRJeRGBvAuAr4YjOy-M-o/edit#gid=0) for the correct remote URL.

## Get changes from the remote

- Local changes, publish to remote: `git push`

- Remote changes, pull to local: `git pull`

. . .

![](img/day2/git_pull_concept.png){width=63% fig-align="center"}

## A simple collaboration workflow

<br>

![](img/day2/collab_simple.png)

- One remote repo on Github, multiple local repos
- Idea: Everyone works on the same branch
  - **Pull before** you start **working**
  - **Push after** you finished **working**
  
## A simple collaboration workflow

<br>

![](img/day2/collab_simple.png)

This works well if

- Repo is not updated often
- You don't work on the same files simultaneously
- No need to discuss changes
  - Everything is directly integrated in main
- You collaborate with yourself

## A simple collaboration workflow

<br>

![](img/day2/collab_simple.png)

This workflow starts to be problematic when

- People push often
  - Conflicts on main
- Not possible to discuss code before integration
- Difficult to just "try something out"
  - Everything goes directly to main
  
## Let's give it a try

::: {.nonincremental}

- Make sure you are in the repository of your team mate
- Open a recipe in the cook book of your team mate
  - **Repository -> Show in Explorer**
- Change something in there
- Commit the change and push it

:::

. . .

::: {.nonincremental}


You team mate now has pushed some changes to your cook book.

Get the changes from the remote. In Github Desktop

- Switch to your own cook book repository
- Pull the changes (Same button as the push button)
- Have a look at the commit history to see what changed

## A branching-merging workflow

<br>

![](img/day2/collab_branching_merging.png)

- One remote repo on Github, multiple local repos
- Idea: Everyone works on the their **separate branch**
  - **Merge** your branch with the main when you are finished 

## A branching-merging workflow

<br>

![](img/day2/collab_branching_merging.png)

#### Advantages of this approach

- Guarantee that main always works
- Potential conflicts don't have to be solved on main
- You can just "try something out"

## Working on a separate branch

The steps to create and work on a separate branch are easy:

![](img/day2/create_branch_stew.png)

- Create a local branch and switch to it
- Work on the branch like you are used to
  - Make changes, **stage** and **commit**, publish and **push**

## Merging changes from a branch

To bring changes to the main branch you need to **merge** them.

![](img/day2/merge_branch_stew_ff.png)

Normally: Git merge brings the commits from the branch to main

## Merging changes from a branch

To bring changes to the main branch you need to **merge** them.

![](img/day2/merge_branch_stew_merge_commit.png)

If there was a commit on a common file in main, a *merge commit* is introduced.

## Merging changes from a branch

To bring changes to the main branch you need to **merge** them.

. . .

- Mostly merging happens without problems, but...
- ... if the same line was edited on separate branches...
- ... there will be a merge conflict :scream:

. . .

Merge conflicts need to be solved manually. You need to chose which of the conflicting
versions you want to keep.

## A branching-merging workflow with Github

- One remote repo on Github, multiple local repos
- Idea: Everyone works on the their separate branch
  - ~~Merge your branch with the main when you are finished~~

::: {.nonincremental}

  - Create a pull request on Github to ask for a merge

## A branching-merging workflow with Github

A pull request is basically asking your collaborators:

> What do you think of my changes? Can we integrate them in main or do we still need to change something?

. . .

Github has nice features for pull requests:

- **Describe your changes** in detail
- Collaborators can easily **compare versions**
- Collaborators can **discuss and comment** on your changes
- ...

A pull request is basically asking your collaborators:

A pull request is merged on Github when **everyone agreed on the code**.

# Thanks for your attention

> Questions?

## Next week

**Idea:** Questions and problems often arise when working with the tool.

**Until then**

Work with Git (~ 2 h), e.g.

- Start using version control for you own projects
- Create a cook book project using the terminal
- Try to use Git from R (see How-To)
- ...

Write down your problems/questions/other Git things you are interested in.

**Next week we will**
- Discuss your questions 
- Look at other interesting Git things todo
  - e.g. Use Git from R, VS Code
  - Use Github to publish websites
  - ...
