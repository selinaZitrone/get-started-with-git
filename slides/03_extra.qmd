The laptop has angry eyes and claws and a wicked smile. In text across the top reads \"gitHUG\" with a small heart." width=75%}

## `git fetch` vs. `git pull`

![Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)](img/day3/fetch_vs_pull.png){fig-alt="Illustration highlighting the difference between git fetch and git pull. On the left (representing git fetch), a crocodile holding a box says to another crocodile eating salad: \"They had a new topping mix at the store. Check it out, it might be good in your salad.\" On the right (representing git pull), a crocodile says \"They had a new topping mix at the store. I bought some and mixed it into your salad\" while a concerned looking crocodile looks at their salad, which now contains the topping mix of insects. Text at the bottom reads \"Check what you're getting before merging it in with git fetch.\"" width=70%}
